I had the most disgusting latte of my life here - true! It had NO foam... it was as hot as liquid coals. There were a swarm of flies everywhere and a loud little girl who was catching them and screaming in delight when she smashed one in her hand.  All of that echoed in that empty, dirty little place and created quite an experience.  There was annoying loud dance music on, which didn't suit the place at all.  The dark chocolate and coconut truffles were pretty tasty.
