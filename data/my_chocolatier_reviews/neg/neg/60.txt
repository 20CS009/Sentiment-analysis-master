I ordered a box of 24 Brigadeiros for Valentine's Day. The ordering process was easy and it came on time.  This is the first time I ordered them and I thought I gave it a try.  I love dark chocolate.  The Brigadeiros tastes like brownies to me (soft doughy). I believe the chocolate is 55%. For $2 a small bite size brownie like chocolate, I am disappointed.
