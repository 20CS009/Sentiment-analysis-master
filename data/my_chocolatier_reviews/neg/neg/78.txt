This review is only based on this one time experience as I normally love Sees, but the only reason I ever go to Sees first and foremost is for the Scotch Kisses. Well it is very disappointing when you walk a mile one way only to get there and find out they are out of Scotch Kisses and in fairness to this store they told me the city was out, but even called another store for me to check. Bad form Sees ...
