I am severely disappointed at how the chocolate quality has decreased in this shop. I actually used to really enjoyed this place with it being new, and having high end chocolate. But after going several times I started to notice that the pricing wasn't worth the small bites any longer. The fillings are now being cheaply filled and made (not much inside to bite into, and that used to be the best part), the quality of chocolate has decreased because it taste old (like it has spent a few nights in the fridge), and the customer service has gone from nice to passive aggressive.
