Just ridiculous prices for the presentation and boutique theme/ambiance. The options were seriously limited as well. The taste and the quantity both left a lot to be desired for the prices they charge. Tartine and Craftsmen and Wolves nearby offers much more in terms of options, taste and value! Not worth.
