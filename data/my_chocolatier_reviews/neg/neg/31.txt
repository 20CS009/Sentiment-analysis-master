I've tried a number of desserts here. From cheesecakes, brownies, cupcakes, and cakes. My boyfriend agrees with me. Only thing I enjoyed was the s'mores cookie. Other than that, flavor isn't the best, it is lacking so much... It's so blah that I don't even finish it at times! And for the price, it isn't worth it; cut the price in half then it would be okay. Sorry, hopefully this changed so I can get sweets when I'm at San Pedro Square. Otherwise, Treatbot is always a winner. After 5 visits here, still disappointed.
