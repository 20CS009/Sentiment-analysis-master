I was dissatisfied on the way the crew prepared my hot chocolate. It was bland. Period. The mediocre hot chocolate could have been compensated by a good service. The staff did not know the difference between a Lactaid and latte. Unfortunately, the staff are more interested in checking their iPhones than doing things the right way. Now, I missed Max Brenner!
