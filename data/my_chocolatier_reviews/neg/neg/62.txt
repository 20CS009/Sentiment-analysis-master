The building looks deceiving. I thought I was going to have a Willy Wonka orgasmic experience. In reality, its just a little store inside. I've tried their chocolate got milk cookies & they tasted like dirt. Their milk chocolate drops didn't taste good (I would've preferred a Hershey bar over this.)  But the espresso & white chocolate drops were yummy!  Surprisingly, they weren't expensive at all!
