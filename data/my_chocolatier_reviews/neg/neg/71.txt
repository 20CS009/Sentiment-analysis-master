I'm afraid i did not like this place one bit, seating area is extremely small (although the store is gigantic), we ordered the -house hot chocolate, -mission hot chocolate, -celebration cake, -dulce de leche bar, as experts in chocolate/cocoa you would automatically have higher expectations in their chocolate and/or desserts unfortunately they fell too short from that, we left extremely disappointed with the overall experience as it was unpleasant to say the least starting from seating till leaving; we stood waiting for around 12-15 minutes just for some1 to leave as the seatings are only but a few, imagine doing that with 2 toddlers! ... after finally finding a table we tasted our neatly cold "hot chocolate", i chose the mission hot chocolate which is advertised as "their spicy take on the mesoamerican original" , drinking this was like drinking lava, my internal organs felt like burning and had an upset stomach till the next day, the dulce bar was tasty however i could not say the same for the cake, cake was mediocre at best and frankly disappointing even my son didn't like it and he loves cake.. I dont like leaving bad reviews only if i really had an unpleasant experience and this was one.. Wont come back and will not recommend.
