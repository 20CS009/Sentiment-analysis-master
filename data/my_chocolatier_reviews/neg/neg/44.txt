Got a selection of truffles and a turtle.  Worst chocolate I've ever had, and WAAAAY too expensive, even it if it was good chocolate. For instance, an Irish Cream Truffle had almost no Irish Cream flavor.  The turtle tasted like nothing. Too bad they feel they can rip off tourists because of the location.  Gives the beautiful location place a bad rap.
