I bought a cone of chocolate covered strawberries for New Year's Eve to share with friends. When I unwrapped them, there was a HAIR stuck between the chocolate. I was so disappointed when I called the store and spoke to the manager. She didn't apologize or even pretended to care, all she said was "Do you have your receipt? Bring it in and we'll refund you."
