ugh...these hipsters are tripping giving me the world's smallest hot chocolate, seriously like 6 ounces for $5.75.  I don't mind spending $$ on quality, but come on, I just felt stupid paying that much for like five sips.  It wasn't even that good, their selection was underwhelming.  I expected it to be at least decent, but it was so bad that I feel the need to spread the word to not go into this hipster money pit of garbage as it was surprisingly busy for the low quality, over-priced crap they were serving. Their horchata was like drinking clumpy cinnamon pudding (and not in a good way).
