Sorry, but totally mediocre chocolates. Hubby and I each got a sampling of chocolates. He got some of the truffles (like Irish Cream, etc.) and I got a Maya Chocolate, a peppermint chew, and a valentine marshmallow heart (My only option if I didn't want a huge bag of marshmallows). The Maya chocolate was the only decent thing. The Peppermint Chew was not chewy at all, but rock hard like a Starlight mint. I should have known it would be bad when I asked for it and the guy waiting on me paused and said That's one of our older recipes. I think he meant older candies! It was either so old it got hard, or it is a misnomer, because there was nothing chewable about that at all. I spit it out in the garbage. The marshmallow heart was equally disappointing with a flavorless marshmallow and a hard, waxy chocolate exterior. Into the garbage it went as well. Hubby said his truffles weren't a good texture either. The chocolate is not creamy. On a positive note, the place smells good when you walk in and it's pretty cute inside. I love that they've been in business forever, but sort of mystified as to why.
