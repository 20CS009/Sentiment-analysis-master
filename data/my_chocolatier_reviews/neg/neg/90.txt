So to start off, no one would talk to us until we went to the counter. And at 6:30, no registers were open. But we were excited as we have been here many times and they HAD amazing sugar free chocolate. To our disappointment, they had very little sugar free at all, and none of it was exciting varieties. It is also quit expensive, but was worth the good sugar free candy. Retail is also lacking. Won't be back...As well as that, we just realized that the buy one pound get on free on candy we got, we were just over 2 pounds like 2.45. They charged us $24 for that 0.45.
