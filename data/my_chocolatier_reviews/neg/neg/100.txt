Yes, the store is totally cute, and old world european looking....But the products are HORRENDOUSLY overpriced, and the staff INCREDIBLY stuck up and rude, like I was privileged to be allowed to shop in their store. Please, if I wanted to pay $3 per piece of chocolate, I could go somewhere else. There are plenty of other artisanal chocolate shops that deliver higher quality with more friendly staff - especially in this neighborhood.
