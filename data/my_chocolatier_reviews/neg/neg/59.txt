Not impressed. I am a chocolate fanatic and this place sadly was nothing special, and most definitely not worth the price tag! It's hard to have "bad" chocolate and I wouldn't call this chocolate bad but it really was just blah. I have no problem spending money on great chocolate but this was just an overpriced excuse.
