I received these chocolates as a gift and while *of course* I am absolutely delighted to receive a thoughtful gift... I just wasn't impressed with the chocolates themselves. They were just kind of lacking in depth of flavor and the texture of the truffles wasn't particularly rich or creamy.  The chocolate itself didn't coat your tongue or fill your palate or linger at all like good chocolate often does and unfortunately for that reason it just tastes cheap.  I hate to say that but I would not go out of my way to get more.
