Overpriced for what it was. The chocolates were interesting and tasty, but at $2.50 a piece, they seemed very expensive. The espresso wasn't particularly strong for a double shot with the milk overpowering the coffee flavor. The service was a little cold and not particularly fast. I live close by but I don't think I'll be going back.
