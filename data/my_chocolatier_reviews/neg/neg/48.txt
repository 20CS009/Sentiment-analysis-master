The chocolate here is pretty average. We came here and got an assortment of their truffles, a cappuccino, and a hot chocolate. The truffles tasted similar to what I would get at Godiva -- really sweet with plain tasting chocolate (no special notes). The hot chocolate was almost undrinkable -- too much milk and way too much sugar. The cappuccino was ok, but I also thought it had a bit too much milk in it. Service was good -- the staff were really friendly.
