This place is exactly the kind of hipster garbage that the mission is so famous for. I got the ginger lemon iced chocolate and it tasted like bitter ass pudding with lemon juice. It also smells weird in here. Everything on the menu is overpriced. They have chocolate making classes which I thought might be cool but it turns out they're 50$. Avoid.
