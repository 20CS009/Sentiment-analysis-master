Went this weekend and boy, was I disappointed!! Yes, they had a LOT of chocolate, M&M's  and all the standard candy you can find at any store but, the 1 Hershey's candy that is new and difficult to find in my local store, was glaringly absent from the store!! There wasn't even a space for Hershey's Chocolate covered Caramel Squares, Milk & Dark Chocolate!! When I asked one of the employees about the candy, she glared at me and said "Isn't this enough for you?" RUDE!!!  Had a Milk Shake here, it tasted like slightly melted ice cream with flavored syrup dumped in. Not mixed, just dumped into glass so, every once in a while, you got a big gulp of syrup flavor.  Bought store made  "S'more".  Marshmallow and the melted chocolate tasted OK, but the Graham cookie has a burnt taste making the complete "S'more cookie" taste disgusting!  I pulled the Graham off & threw away.  If I had a choice of going to this Hershey Store or the Dentist, I would choose the Dentist!!
