Wow. What an expensive yet disgusting piece of dark chocolate. How can you not have any vegan treats? And why be so rude about it when I asked?! The only thing they had was some unsweet chunk of something nasty I spit out for like 20 dollars. Why bother?!Update yo stuff y'all! Vegans are taking over the world. Step it up!! I'll come back when you do.
