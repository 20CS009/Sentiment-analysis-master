Wandered in to this tiny chocolate shop today at lunchtime.  Turns out they are only open at lunchtime, so I guess I was lucky.  I bought a few different chocolates and was disappointed.  They were waxy and stale.  For the price they charge, I don't think I would give them another try.  Maybe when that endless, mess of a mall renovation in downtown Sunnyvale ever gets completed, this place will get enough foot traffic to move the product along a little quicker.
