Went in today to purchase a birthday gift for someone on a restricted diet. I knew Kron carried sugar free chocolate. My first disappointment was how long it took someone to come down from the office/ kitchen to help me. There were three people working, all to busy to stop and come down, or at least acknowledge I was in the store. Then I was more disappointed when I said I wanted to purchase $10-$15 dollars worth of individual pieces of chocolate, I then asked if they could be put. In a box, I was told they only have bags for individual candy.  Just so you understand, they package everything in the store, they have various sizes of boxes. Yet, I could not have one. Then I left!
