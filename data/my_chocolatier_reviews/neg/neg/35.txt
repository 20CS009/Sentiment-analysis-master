This place was surprisingly bad... and ultra overpriced. Each chocolate is $2 and all of ours tasted exactly the same. The Welsh Sea Salt Caramel, Hard Caramel, Fresh Caramel, all had the exact same filling despite different titles and none of them tasted like caramel. All were dry in the middle and vaguely mealy, but the chocolate on the exterior was good.It might be the worst chocolate I've ever had. Eek. Service was helpful, but the product quality as really bad, and the price-point even worse.
