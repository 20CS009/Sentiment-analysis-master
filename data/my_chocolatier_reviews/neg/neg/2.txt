Super rude. We arrived here at 9:30 pm on a Saturday night and then waited in line for 15 minutes. When we got to the front of the line, and ordered our desserts we obviously wanted to eat there, the cashier told us we could only take them to go since they closed at 10. Really?! How long does it take to eat a dessert? And why not just tell everyone that before they waited in your line? We left without buying anything and will not be back.
