Extremely poor customer service the old skinny white lady is rude and I don't think she likes ethnic minorities. She touched my candy with her bare hands - gross! Huffed and puffed when I asked her for a sample (1 sample, I'm not the greedy type) she was semi flirting with my boyfriend and didn't pay any attention to me or my questions even though I was the one buying. I can't stand customer service that sucks. This is the 3rd time now, thought she would change but she hasn't. Seems like all the ladies that work there are stuck up and rude, no need for all that, just be nice and do your job. Il just go elsewhere from now on
