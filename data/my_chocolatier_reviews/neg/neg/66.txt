You really do feel like a kid again strolling the aisles of overflowing bins of candy. And the girl at the counter was about as sweet as a gum drop... but the prices are insane... $17.99 per lb for the pecan carmel patties. The candy and chocolates are actually pretty mediocre and the prices are strictly for the tourist.
