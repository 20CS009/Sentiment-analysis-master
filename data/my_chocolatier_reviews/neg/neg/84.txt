If you have never tasted real chocolate and you're used to Hershey maybe you can think that this so good because of the price and the shape and the color and what not. But if you have ever tried real gourmet chocolate (e.g., shopping at Sprungly in Zurich, something from the a nice shop in Wien S. Stefan cathedral plaza (i do not remember the name) or something from the Piedmont region in Italy) this chocolate is like putting a dirty sock filled with a stick of butter in your mouth. OVERRATED.
