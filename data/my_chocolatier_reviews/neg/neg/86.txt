Not sure what the fuss is about this cafe. We ordered a croissant, a hot chocolate and a cappuccino. The croissant  was a standard American style tasteless croissant that you could get in any supermarket. The cappuccino was strong - too strong - and lacked any flavor. The hot chocolate was the worst we ever had. Certainly not the best and far from it. All in all - this cafe is a total disappointment. There are so many other options. Go there instead.
