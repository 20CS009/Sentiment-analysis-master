Im 16 years old and I got these DISAPPOINTING chocolates for valentines day. The captivating colors and delicious sounding names made me think that these would be the best chocolates I've ever had also considering they were also 3 dollars a piece. But they were GROSS!!! I took a small bite out of 3 different flavors and had to spit it out because I almost through up. It tastes like someone painted them with HOUSE PAINT MIXED WITH SUGAR WATER. They're completely OVERPRICED and in fact worse than any chocolate I've had. I don't recommend these for anybody unless you like chocolates that TASTE HORRIBLE and leave a DISGUSTING AFTERTASTE that won't go away. Some of the other reviews say that you have to have a mature palette to like these chocolates, but neither mom or grandma liked the taste either and we ended up throwing away the chocolate and writing this review.
