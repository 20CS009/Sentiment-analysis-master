Simply incredible chocolate that is worth the trek out to Dogpatch - or get a friend to go and bring some back. It's great for gifts and they offer customized boxes with 8 squares, 16 or up to 32 (maybe more) squares. Each chocolate is delicious - with sea salt sprinkled on top. Rich, decadent, and a great find - don't forget to try all the samples while they wrap up your chocolate treats!!
