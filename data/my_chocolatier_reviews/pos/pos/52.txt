The cookies are to die for!! They're huge and, though the gourmet price seems kind of steep at about $3 a cookie, they are absolutely delicious. I got the s'mores and chocolate chip. Both were equally ooey and gooey but the butter cookie flavor didn't make the chocolate so overwhelming. Neither of them made it home to Sacramento that's for sure!
