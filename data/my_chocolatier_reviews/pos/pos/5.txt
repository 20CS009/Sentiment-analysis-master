I tasted a bunch of chocolate samples and it was super cool, so many cocoa beans from many different countries, all uniquely profiled for taste and flavors. It's definitely not cheap though, it's between $8-12 dollars for each bar of chocolate and I ended up getting two. The best, most amazing thing about their chocolate is that they create their bars in the actual store and it goes all the way back. You can also time your visit and do a tour as well. I got to hold a cocoa bean which was much larger than I thought and super exciting for a chocolate lover like myself. All of the chocolate bars are also made with cocoa beans and cane sugar only which is nice, no other additives, coloring, artificial flavors, etc.
