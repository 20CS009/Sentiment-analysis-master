THE ABSOLUTE BEST HOT CHOCOLATE. While the price of their house hot chocolate or anything on their menu was not cheap, I decided to trust the reviews and go with it. Within 2 minutes my hot chocolate was ready, in a smaller cup than expected but let me tell you that size really does NOT matter. The hot chocolate was sweet and creamy, everything I could imagine of an ideal hot chocolate. If I'm ever around I will definitely go back and probably order two drinks of deliciousness!
