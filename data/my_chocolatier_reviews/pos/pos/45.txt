Anyone who knows me knows I cannot walk past a candy store, especially if it has chocolate gummy bears. Long story short, this is the best candy store I've been in. I came out with more than just chocolate covered gummy bears.The store is huge and beautifully decorated. It's colorful and is categorized by chocolate, gummies, sours,popcorn, alcohol content, and even country of origin. There's candy from Japan, Europe, etc. The storefront has a bar of truffles and a refrigerator with all sorts of beverages- even butter beer!
