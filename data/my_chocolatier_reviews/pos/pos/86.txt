I went to Feve for a Carmel and Chocolate Confections class and fell in love with these amazing chocolates!  Shawn Williams is a perfectionist and if there is a must do to place for foodies (or anyone with a passion for chocolate), make sure you stop in and try these amazing works of art! Perfect balance, incredible sheen and something you will savor and remember for days . . .  It's been only two days and I can't wait to go back for more. Packaging for the 9 chocolates as a gift made an amazing gift for a friend and the chocolate covered nuts were scrumptious.
