Best chocolate drinks and candies I have ever tasted.  The staff are very well versed in what they are selling and pleasingly helpful.  Was given a tour of the kitchen and loved the way they were accommodating to our group. Bought lots of their boxed goodies to give away as gifts to my folks back home... and boy, were they super happy!
