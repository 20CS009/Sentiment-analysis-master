These chocolates are absolutely amazing. The hard outer shell and the melt in your mouth inside... make these chocolates out of this word. I purchased a variety box of 9 because I wanted to try the different filling flavors... each was better than the last. The texture is incredible, and these chocolates are just the RIGHT richness. Sometimes you find yourself needing a glass of water after eating some more intense chocolate, but the ingredients are so high quality, Phillippe really makes the perfect truffle
