I've been going here for a few years and this place never disappoints! They're cookies are perfectly baked with a slight crunch on the edge and a rich, soft texture in the middle. I always get the s'mores cookie. There's no other cookie like it! They've been consistently delicious ( baked to perfection every time). They're very rich with generous portions of ingredients. I've also tried they're truffles, pecan bar, bacon choco bar, macaroons and coffee. All were satisfying. It's nice to be able to have a different dessert option other than ice cream! Service is great. They're quick to assist and happy to answer any questions regarding their several desserts.
