Wow! I walked by recently and decided to follow my nose, leading me into this den of chocolate decadence. They make their own chocolate from 2 ingredients: single origin cacao beans from different countries and sugar. When you enter the space, you are immediately drawn to the samples of chocolate bars that differ by provenance. They also make sweets including s'mores and cookies, hot chocolate and mocha drinks. Everything I tried was pure delight. I would highly recommended Dandelion to any chocolate lover and anyone taking a degustation tour of the Mission!
