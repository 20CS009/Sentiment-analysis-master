Great sampler for bite sized appetites, the pic is upside down because I was too excited to turn it around and you get the idea anyway, it's delicious! Go for the full sized S'mores AND frozen hot chocolate! The true dark rich (but not too bitter) chocolate is well worth the wait in line, you'll see!
