The best customer service and a clean location. My go-tos for gifts for friends, family and myself are: Toffee-ettes, Nuts and Chews and their seasonal special boxes for children. That's right! I'm that girl who will pump your child full of sugar and give them back to you! (sweet evil laugh) Seriously though, this place never disappoints even if you need a delicious chocolate fix. Enjoy!!
