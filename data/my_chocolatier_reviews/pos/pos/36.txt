I've had the the four barrel mission mocha which was one of the best mochas I've ever had. It's only slightly sweet and a tad spicy. It's almost like a really good chai flavor with mocha and espresso. The drink sizes are pretty small, but you have to remember you are getting a product made with quality ingredients.
