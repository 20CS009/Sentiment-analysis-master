A really great cute cafe and really friendly staff! Few things I would recommend doing when you get there: 1) Try out all the free chocolate samples 2) Chat with the staff and learn more about how a coffee bean turns into a chocolate bar 3) Get a factory tour (make a reservation online) and 4) buy some goodies (would highly recommend dulce de leche bar).
