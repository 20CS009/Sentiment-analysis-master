We were mainly there for the european drinking hot chocolate ($4.50). It came in a perfectly designed sipping cup/stand with a cookie treat. Very well thought out design. It wasnt a huge serving of hot chocolate but its because you dont need much of it. It's very rich and flavorful. Dandelion boasts that they only use 2 ingredients in their chocolate. That's cocoa beans and cane sugar. Chocolate purists indeed. We sampled their house made smores and it was very good. Different from your traditional but it was good. Homemade graham cracker on the bottom, chocolate layer and a marshmallow topping layered over that. It was good. It's quite sweet but it was good
