It's so good! No bad flavors, every flavor is delicious in it's own way!! I wish I live closer to this shop so I can have it all the time!! Customer service is also great here! I usually don't like chocolates, but those are just wonderful! Not overly sweet, just smooth and balanced, visually stunning as well!! I wish they would ship, so I can send them out to friends and family as gifts.
