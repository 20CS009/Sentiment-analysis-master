We ordered the European drinking chocolate and the spicy hot chocolate upon recommendation from the girl who rang us up. We also ordered a s'mores! It was the prettiest s'mores I've ever seen and tasted so good, not too sweet at all and the chocolate was high quality. The hot chocolates came in cute little drinking cups and mine came with a little spoon to stir. The European drinking chocolate was amazing! Super chocolatey and thick, kinda gets to be too much though as it cools down.
