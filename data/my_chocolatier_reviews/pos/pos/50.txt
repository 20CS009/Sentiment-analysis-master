The Chocolate Dream Box offers exquisitly tasty and beautiful candies that are a wonderful indulgence - and they make a great gift.  There you can find truffles, but also specialty items such as dark or milk chocolate cats, marshmallow hearts, goofy looking chocolate frogs or any number of seasonal items.  The price is good for the quality of the items offered for sale.  The new location is large and bright, and as always, the people working there are knowledgeable and pleasant.  I'd have given this place six out of five stars had the system let me.
