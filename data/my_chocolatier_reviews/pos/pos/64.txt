These chocolates are really amazing!  On top of that, the couple that makes these chocolates is extremely  nice. Be sure to call or text before dropping by, as their location is a rental kitchen (they are not always there). We were lucky enough to drop by right before a big show. We were able to try a ton of different delicious  chocolates and bought the biggest box they sell. The price is amazing for the top notch quality. Highly recommend!
