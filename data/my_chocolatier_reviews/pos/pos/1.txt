Such amazing chocolate! The first time I had Dandelion was at a sake tasting at Beshock in San Diego. I was blown away by the chocolate (and how well it went with sake!), so I was very excited when I got to visit the location in San Francisco. Upon arrival, I was at a loss for words. There was so much chocolate and so many delicious smells. I tried numerous chocolates, all wonderful. My favorite was one of the nutty ones. I went to order and as soon as I saw a s'more, I just ordered immediately and didn't look at anything else, which I probably should have. But after eating the s'more, nothing else in the world mattered because it was the most delicious thing I had every put in my mouth. I tasted the brownie flight and the chocolate blueberry corn bread muffin, but those were nothing compared to my s'more (I mean they were delicious too, but I was on cloud 9, aka their marshmallows) it was not as good. I stopped here again to grab a cup of Four Barrel on my way out of town. I love this place with most all of my being.
