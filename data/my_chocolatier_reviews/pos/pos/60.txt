I love Chocolate Visions. It is a local business and their chocolate is fantastic. There are plenty of unique and elegant truffles to choose from, there's gelatto for a fun treat, the store has a great location near the movie theater, and the people working are always sweet and helpful. I am so happy that Chocolate Visions has a home in Scotts Valley!
