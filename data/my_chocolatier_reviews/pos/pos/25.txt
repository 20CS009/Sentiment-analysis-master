 I also had the giant s'mores. Oh my god. Love the way how the workers torched the s'mores to make the chocolate in the center of the marshmellow melty and the marshmellow toasty. I went to s'more heaven :) I love this place because the chocolate is so authentic and made from different kinds of regions. What a chocolaticious experience. I will probably need to get european hot chocolate next time. If you have a sweet tooth for sweets and you need a nice treat from the cold chilly night, this is a wonderful place to go :)
