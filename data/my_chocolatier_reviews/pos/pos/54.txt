This is THE best chocolate ever!! It would make the best gifts for others (or yourself!) I especially love the milk macadamia nut, their dark rocky road bar, the caramels... all of it is amazing! Everyone I've shared their chocolate with has raved about it. It's also nice that you can get their chocolates at Whole Foods and online and they deliver everywhere!All of their products are quality with attention to detail.
