Just amazing!! Was my first visit to the Mission and Castro part of the city and was blown away by the sheer food options around. This place was amazing, and with a huge huge line to boot. I basically walked away the first time as the line was out of the door. Went back at 930pm, still had a line, but just 3 people in front of me. Since it was late I got the frozen hot chocolate which was out of this world! I'll be back to try the chocolate tasting flight!!
