This place is the cutest, and they have a fantastic selection of HIGH QUALITY candy. Their gummy bears aren't just standard gummy bears - they come in flavors like bing cherry, mango, and fresh strawberry. They have such a fun assortment of old-timey candies (including a huge variety of licorice, hard candies from Europe, etc.), and newer, adventurous candies (such as seasonal gingerbread gummies, or ice cream cone candies). And the chocolates and chocolate-covered candy are equally as impressive (I recommend the chocolate-covered caramel corn). Even better, the staff is super friendly and helpful. The woman behind the counter walked me through my different choices, helped me bag my candy, and even offered me a free sample of some hard sour candies to help with my pregnancy nausea. I'll definitely be back for some gifts, and for myself!
