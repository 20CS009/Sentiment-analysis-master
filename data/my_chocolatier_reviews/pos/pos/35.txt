This place was incredible! It's a chocolate shop with everything you'd ever want to be inside a chocolate shop. There's seats so you can enjoy with friends. You can get a plain chocolate bar or some hot cocoa. And, the hot cocoa comes in an adorable little cup with freshly made marshmallows. There's also a selection of desserts to choose from. The whole place has a decor that makes you think you're in a chocolate factory and it even smells of chocolate here. Come here to chat with a friend or to get a wonderful snack for yourself but if you're in the area, this is a unique and wonderful find that shouldn't be missed.
