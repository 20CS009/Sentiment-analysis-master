One of my all-time favorites. This is a hometown chocolate company producing authentic Brazilian brigadeiros. They're soft and delicate chocolate spheres rolled around in all things nutty and delicious. Cute packaging make them perfect gifts too. Highly recommend visiting them now before they scale up!
