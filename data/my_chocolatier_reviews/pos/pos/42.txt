What a beautiful little candy shop! The treats are as delicious as they are beautiful. I received superb service from April who was kind enough to help me select items for a gift basket. She then artfully arranged the items and wrapped the basket in cello and tied it with an elaborate bow that was the perfect touch! She was friendly and kind and I will most definitely be back!
