This was my first visit to Castro and Mission neighborhood and this Dandelion place is amazing!! Everything looked very tasty and inviting. I tried the Chef's tasting menu and it was delicious. The red velvet and panda cotta was delicious.. panda cotta was my favorite! There is always a line irrespective of the time you reach Dandelion.. be it noon evening or late night (Yes we went that many times)!! The place is elegantly decorated and you can try different chocolates from different parts of the world. They even have a small exhibit inside to show the process of chocolate making. Definitely a must visit if you are a chocolate addict :)
