Come and try their European drinking hot chocolate!! It's the best I've had! Perfect consistency and not too sweet. We came here on a. Old rainy day which made it even better! The place is cute but with limited seating but you should definitely give this place a try if you're in the area.i also saw some people with the cold chocolate dessert which also looks amazing and that's probably what I'll try next if I go on a warmer day!
