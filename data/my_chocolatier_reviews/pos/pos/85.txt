Feve chocolates are delicious pieces of art. Not only do they look beautiful, but taste like nothing else I've found in stores. Plus, it is so great to support a local producer right here in the City, especially knowing that nowhere else in the world you can get this unique chocolate. Highly recommend for gifts and personal use.
