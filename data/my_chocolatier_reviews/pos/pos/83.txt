Dayum son this is some really really really tasty chocolate. I love chocolate and, for my palate, it is very difficult to get chocolate as wonderful as Feve. I was lucky enough to receive the natural truffle box (9 pieces for $22) as a gift recently and has blown me away. I never heard about Feve before this gift and boy was I in for a treat! Each piece is beautifully made and manages to provide a delicate yet very intense chocolate experience without being overly sweet. What I mean by delicate is that it has a nice soft chew- not like you're biting into a hard piece of chocolate or not gooey either (at least the pieces I've eaten before). I think it's really nicely balanced. You'll have to try it to understand.
