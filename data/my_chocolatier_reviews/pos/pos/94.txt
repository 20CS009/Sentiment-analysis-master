These chocolates will satisfy even the most discerning chocolaholic. My personal favorite (I'm also a coffee fiend), is the coffee toffee dark chocolate bar. You can taste the coffee at first bite and all the way through. And the toffee is handmade. Only the best ingredients are used in all the products. Chuck is a really nice guy, too, eager to talk about anything to do with his business.
