Really delicious, handmade chocolates in different (and interesting flavors) like Aztec chili. Their chocolates make great gifts from SF and they offer seasonal items too, including Easter and Thanksgiving mold-shaped chocolates. The factory now has a chocolate storefront, which is nice because you can stop by and pick up some great treats straight from the factory now.
