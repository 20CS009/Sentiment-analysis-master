They have displays on the counter that is super helpful when it comes to choosing what you want! The Chef's Tasting was amazing and all too adorable! They were miniature and bite sized with a little tiny fork and knife! Ahh! The chocolate is so rich, dense and perfectly sweetened. You can honestly taste the quality! The bubbly milk shake was like a dark chocolate champagne and so fun to drink! I loved the bubblies! The mini striped straw was sooo cute! Their mini s'more was so fresh with the perfect squish of marshmallow with the chocolate graham bottom. I don't want to describe everything so you can go and have a taste test yourself! I think you'll like it :)!
