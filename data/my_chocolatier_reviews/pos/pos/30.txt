The interior is warm and welcoming and the scent of chocolate is quite enticing. I have had this place bookmarked forever and was so excited to finally get here! The chocolate bars are pricey but they are single origin and like fine wine, there are flavor notes offered by each bar depending where the beans are sourced. Samples are offered. The glass case of sweets all looked so good but it was still early so I opted for a cup of hot chocolate. They offer almond milk and soymilk for non dairy folks like myself. I ordered the house hot chocolate which came with a mini cocoa shortbread cookie. They also offer nuggets of raw sugar  (for coffee) and housemade marshmallows to top my chocolate. Goodness they are like pillows from heaven! The hot chocolate itself was one of the best I've ever had. The texture was like velvet, not overly sweet, and nicely frothy on top. I will remember this hot chocolate for the rest of my life! Service was on point
