Poco Dolce makes some of the best chocolates and toffees that I have ever had.  Everything is amazing- in particular the grey sea-salt tiles- my personal favorite.  I try to resist, but I keep on coming back for more.  Most recently, I purchased and subsequently devoured a bag of their spicy peanut brittle, and I'm addicted now.  I'll be back for more soon, sure enough.
