Two words: Absolutely Amazing! I LOVE chocolate and this is my go to spot.  The chocolate is so FRESH, juicy, and tasty- you know it was made with TLC. My favorite choclates are the milk chocolate peanut butter -anything (cups, seasonal treats). I use to like the wine paring chocolates, but now they are too rich for me. Place is affordable. Some expensive chocolates but worth it. My second favorite chocolates are the white chocolates. Every holiday, Schurra's has seasonal fresh chocolates just perfect for the holiday. Recently, I purchases peanut butter eggs, white chocolate carrot, chocolate covered pretzels for my kids' Easter basket. If you are local and never been, you have to stop by and check out. You can order individual chocolates. Come in and have a taste. I am positive it will not be your last visit.
