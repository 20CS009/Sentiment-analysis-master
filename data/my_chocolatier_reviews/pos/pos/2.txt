Anyway, the drinks here are marvelous.  Next time I'd probably go with their tea (loose leaf) if I wanted a dessert.  I decided to go whole hog though and get their frozen hot chocolate and a Paris Brest I think it was called (like a brioche or donut sandwich with cream in the middle).  Their drinks come with a very cute little chocolate cookie which was quite tasty. They also have classes and events, which I would like to try one day.
